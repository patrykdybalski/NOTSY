# NOTSY

The NOTSY project is a fast and lightweight, simple packed, and user friendly tool that lets you record your plans, simple notes, and check the current weather along with a one-day weather forecast.
The project was created to develop my skills and portfolio. The idea for the application was taken from my own needs, from now on I have three functions that I use every day.
